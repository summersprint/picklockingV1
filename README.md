# picklockingV1

this is the basic version for now :)


bug: the car window will be smashed 


how too use just press f when you near a car if its locked then picklocking will start
right now its based on a roll system 1 - 100 if you have rolled over 80 then you get the car unlocked if not you just get a error message no succed


ps: just add to server.cfg this only work if the car  is locked and the driverseat is free :) 


feature will be with alert system and much more but other script get create first will make a advanced / lock + unlock + picklock + alert system work together
